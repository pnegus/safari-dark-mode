# safari-dark-mode
simple dark mode extension for safari

this extension works by applying a simple inversion filter to pages

it does 3 checks:

1) first, a check for a dark color-scheme property
2) second, a check for dark text
3) third, a check for a dark background

and applies the filter based on the results of these checks

The extension does no host-based filtering, and does not filter by element. Some colors may look a little off.
